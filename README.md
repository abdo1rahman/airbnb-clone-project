# airbnb-clone-project

This project is a full-stack clone of the popular accommodation booking platform AirBnB. The goal is to build a functional web application that allows users to browse property listings, view detailed property information, and complete bookings. The project will cover frontend development, backend APIs, database design, and deployment.

## UI/UX Design Planning:
* ***Intuitive booking flow for users:***
    * Create vertical (main) list of horizontal sub-lists
    * The main lists will contain the cities, countries, etc.
    * The horizontal lists will contain the hotel options
    * Every item will have its *title*, *price*, and *rating*
* ***Loading time has to be low*** to maintain optimal user-experience
* ***Design has to be responive on all sizes***
* ***On Mobile:***
    * The main page shouldn't change much from desktop design except for thumbnail imgage size and the navbar being on the bottom of the page for easy access
    * ***Inisde the rooms page***:
        * The hotel's image should occupy the full width of the page followed by the details under it
        * The submit cart (the one with the price and *"Reserve"* button) will be fixed on the bottom of the page

## Key Features:
* Property search and filtering for: *price, class, place, services, and availability*
* Secure checkout process
* User authentication
